#PivotTable.js

PivotTable.js is a Javascript Pivot Table library with drag'n'drop functionality built on top of jQuery/jQueryUI and originally written in CoffeeScript by [Nicolas Kruchten](http://nicolas.kruchten.com) at [Datacratic](http://datacratic.com).

##What does it do?

PivotTable.js' basic function is to turn a data set into a summary table and then optionally add a true 2-d drag'n'drop UI to allow a user to manipulate this summary table, turning it into a pivot table, very similar to the one found in older versions of Microsoft Excel with a bunch of extra developer-oriented features and some visualization effects.


##Features

* works with common input formats
* layered architecture allows for summary table generation with or without the pivot table UI around it (if you don't use the UI, then there is no dependency on jQueryUI)
* derived columns can be created on the fly based on the whole input row by passing in a function
* complex aggregation functions can compute values based on the whole input row (i.e. weighted averages)
* built-in support for basic heatmap and bar chart visualization
* extension points allow aggregation functions, table output, UI and visualizations to be tailored to specific applications
* works acceptably fast in Chrome on commodity hardware up to hundreds of thousands of rows with a dozen attributes

##Where's the demo?

A demo of PivotTable.js loaded up with a sample dataset of Canadian Members of Parliament as of 2012 can be found here: [PivotTable.js demo](http://nicolaskruchten.github.io/pivottable/mps_prepop.html).

##How do you use the UI?

PivotTable.js implements a pivot table drag'n'drop UI similar to that found in popular spreadsheet programs. You can drag variables into/out of the row/column areas, and choose a summary function. If you choose a summary function that takes an argument, like 'average', you'll have to drag a variable onto the dropdown.

### Now you do it: Age distribution bar chart by Gender

### You can also exclude some rows

##How does the code work?

There are two main functions defined in `pivot.coffee`: `pivot()` and `pivotUI()`, both implemented as jQuery plugins, as well as a bunch of helpers and templates.

Despite the fact that this is described as a Javascript library, it's actually written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org). You can compile `pivot.coffee` into `pivot.js` with `coffee -c pivot.coffee` or you can use the precompiled JS file from the `examples` directory.

Once you've loaded jQuery and pivot.js, this code ([demo](http://nicolaskruchten.github.io/pivottable/simple.html)):

	$("#output").pivot(
	    [
	        {color: "blue", shape: "circle"},
	        {color: "red", shape: "triangle"}
	    ],
	    {
	        rows: ["color"],
	        cols: ["shape"]
	    }
	);

appends this table to `$("#output")` (the default, *overridable* behaviour is to populate the table cells with counts):

<table class="pvtTable"><tbody><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"></th><th class="pvtAxisLabel">shape</th><th class="pvtColLabel" colspan="1" rowspan="2">circle</th><th class="pvtColLabel" colspan="1" rowspan="2">triangle</th><th class="pvtTotalLabel" rowspan="2">Totals</th></tr><tr><th class="pvtAxisLabel">color</th><th></th></tr><tr><th class="pvtRowLabel" rowspan="1" colspan="2">blue</th><td class="pvtVal row0 col0">1</td><td class="pvtVal row0 col1"></td><td class="pvtTotal rowTotal">1</td></tr><tr><th class="pvtRowLabel" rowspan="1" colspan="2">red</th><td class="pvtVal row1 col0"></td><td class="pvtVal row1 col1">1</td><td class="pvtTotal rowTotal">1</td></tr><tr><th class="pvtTotalLabel" colspan="2">Totals</th><td class="pvtTotal colTotal">1</td><td class="pvtTotal colTotal">1</td><td class="pvtGrandTotal">2</td></tr></tbody></table>

A slight change to the code (calling `pivotUI()` instead of `pivot()` ) yeilds the same table with a drag'n'drop UI around it, so long as you've imported jQueryUI ([demo](http://nicolaskruchten.github.io/pivottable/simple_ui.html)):

	$("#output").pivotUI(
	    [
	        {color: "blue", shape: "circle"},
	        {color: "red", shape: "triangle"}
	    ],
	    {
	        rows: ["color"],
	        cols: ["shape"]
	    }
	);

###Parameters

####`pivot(input [,options])`

`pivot` will inject an HTML table into the object onto which it is called, which will summarize `input` according to `options`.

`input` is an array of objects, or a jQuery object referencing a table (see next section).

`options` is an object with the following keys:

* `rows`: array of variable names to use as rows
* `cols`: array of variable names for use as columns
* `aggregator`: constructor for an object which will aggregate results per cell (see source)
* `derivedAttributes`: object to define derived attributes (see [demo](http://nicolaskruchten.github.io/pivottable/mps_prepop.html))
* `filter`: function called on each row, returns `false` if the row is to be excluded from the output
* `postProcessor`: function called on the output before function returns (used by `pivotUI` to do visualization effects like `heatmap` and `barchart`)


####`pivotUI(input [,options])`

`pivotUI` will essentiall draw a UI and then call `pivot`. It will call `pivot` every time the UI is changed via a drag'n'drop or an aggregator selection. The `options` object lets you set up the UI itself in terms of what visualization aggregators and effects are offered, and it lets you prepopulate the various options as well.

`input` is an array of objects, or a jQuery object referencing a table (see next section).

`options` is an object with the following keys:

* `effects`: dictionary of post-processing visualization functions
* `aggregators`: dictionary of constructors for aggregation functions in dropdown
* `rows`: array of variable names to prepopulate in row area
* `cols`: array of variable names to prepopulate in cols area
* `vals`: array of variable names to prepopulate in vals area
* `aggregatorName`: aggregator to prepopulate in dropdown
* `effectsName`: effects to prepopulate in radio button
* `derivedAttributes`: object to define derived attributes (passed through to `pivot()`)

(You can also view-source on the [demo](http://nicolaskruchten.github.io/pivottable/mps_prepop.html) or log a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/issues) if this isn't clear enough)
