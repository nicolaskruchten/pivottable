# PivotTable.js

PivotTable.js is a Javascript Pivot Table library with drag'n'drop functionality built on top of jQuery/jQueryUI and originally written in CoffeeScript by [Nicolas Kruchten](http://nicolas.kruchten.com) at [Datacratic](http://datacratic.com).

It is available under an MIT license from [CDNJS](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/pivottable) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pivottable) and [Bower](http://bower.io/) under the name `pivottable`. And on [Packagist.org](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable), it is `nicolaskruchten/pivottable`. 

PivotTable.js can be used with [Python/Jupyter](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pivottablejs) and [R/RStudio](https://github.com/smartinsightsfromdata/rpivotTable) and you can [try it right now](http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/local.html) in your browser on a CSV file.

## What does it do?

PivotTable.js' basic function is to enable data exploration and analysis by turning a data set into a summary table and then optionally adding a true 2-d drag'n'drop UI to allow a user to manipulate this summary table, turning it into a pivot table, very similar to the one found in older versions of Microsoft Excel with a bunch of extra developer-oriented features and some visualization effects. With [optional add-ons](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Optional-Extra-Renderers), the summary table can be rendered as various kinds of charts, turning the pivot table into a pivot chart.

The animation above is based on the [Canadian Parliament 2012 dataset example](http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/fully_loaded.html).

## Where are the demos/examples?

There are lots on the [examples page](http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/index.html) but here are some good entry points:

* [a JSFiddle where you can play with the code](https://jsfiddle.net/nicolaskruchten/kn381h7s/)
* [a simple demo running on the "Canadian Parliament 2012" dataset](http://nicolaskruchten.github.io/pivottable/examples/mps_prepop.html)
* [fully-loaded demo running on the 700+ datasets that ship with R](http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/rcsvs.html)
* [fully-loaded demo where you provide your own CSV file for input](http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/local.html)

## Why is it good?

* it's lightweight: the core (without chart support) is a single file with less than 1000 LOC of CoffeeScript, compiles down to 6.3kb of Javascript minified and gzipped, and depends only on jQuery and jQueryUI's 'sortable'
* it works wherever jQuery and jQueryUI work (tested with jQuery 1.8.3 and jQueryUI 1.9.2)
* it works acceptably fast in Chrome on commodity hardware up to around a hundred thousand records, depending on the cardinality of the attributes.
* its UI is [localizable](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Localization)
* its layered architecture allows for summary table generation with or without the pivot table UI around it (if you don't use the UI, then there is no dependency on jQueryUI)
* it works with common [input formats](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Input-Formats)
* its [derived attributes](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Derived-Attributes) can be created on the fly based on the whole input record by passing in a function
* its complex [aggregation functions](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Aggregators) can compute values based on the whole input record (e.g. weighted averages)
* it has built-in support for basic heatmap and bar chart [renderers](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Renderers), and [optional extra renderers that add charting or TSV export support](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Optional-Extra-Renderers)
* its extension points allow aggregation functions, table output, UI and visualizations to be tailored to specific applications
* it works on mobile devices with [jQuery UI Touch Punch](http://touchpunch.furf.com/)
* it has a [test suite](http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/tests)

## How do I use the UI?

PivotTable.js implements a pivot table drag'n'drop UI similar to that found in popular spreadsheet programs. You can drag attributes into/out of the row/column areas, and specify rendering, aggregation and filtering options. There is a [step-by-step tutorial](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/UI-Tutorial) in the wiki.

## How do I load the code?

PivotTable.js implements the [Universal Module Definition (UMD)](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) pattern and so should be compatible with most approaches to script loading and dependency management: direct script loading i.e. from [CDNJS](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/pivottable) or with [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/), [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) etc. For the latter options, you can grab it from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pivottable) with `npm install pivottable` or via [Bower](http://bower.io/) with `bower install pivottable`.

If you are loading the scripts directly (as in the [examples](http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable)), you need to:

1. load the dependencies:
  1. jQuery in all cases
  2. jQueryUI for the interactive `pivotUI()` function (see below)
  3. D3.js, C3.js and/or Google Charts if you use [charting plugins](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Optional-Extra-Renderers)
2. load the PivotTable.js files:
  1. `pivot.min.js`
  2. any [plugins](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Optional-Extra-Renderers) you wish to use

The dependencies and PivotTable.js files can be loaded:

  1. By copying the files from their official distributions to your project and loading them locally (the [`dist`](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/tree/master/dist) directory is where you will find the PivotTable.js files)
  2. From a Content Distribution Network (CDN) like [CDNJS](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/pivottable)

(The [examples](http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable) load dependencies from CDNJS and PivotTable.js locally)

## How do I use the code?

There are two main functions provided by PivotTable.js: `pivot()` and `pivotUI()`, both implemented as jQuery plugins, as well as a bunch of helpers and templates.

### `pivot()`

Once you've loaded jQuery and pivot.js, this code ([demo](http://nicolaskruchten.github.io/pivottable/examples/simple.html)):

```javascript
$("#output").pivot(
    [
        {color: "blue", shape: "circle"},
        {color: "red", shape: "triangle"}
    ],
    {
        rows: ["color"],
        cols: ["shape"]
    }
);
```

appends this table to `$("#output")` (the default, *overridable* behaviour is to populate the table cells with counts):

### `pivotUI()`

A slight change to the code (calling `pivotUI()` instead of `pivot()` ) yields the same table with a drag'n'drop UI around it, so long as you've imported jQueryUI ([demo](http://nicolaskruchten.github.io/pivottable/examples/simple_ui.html)):

```javascript
$("#output").pivotUI(
    [
        {color: "blue", shape: "circle"},
        {color: "red", shape: "triangle"}
    ],
    {
        rows: ["color"],
        cols: ["shape"]
    }
);
```

Note that **`pivot()` and `pivotUI()` take different parameters in general**, even though in the example above we passed the same parameters to both. See the [FAQ](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#params).

See the wiki for [full parameter documentation](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Parameters).

## How can I build the code and run the tests?

To install the development dependencies, just run `npm install`, which will create a `node_modules` directory with the files required to run the [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) build system.

After modifying any of the `.coffee` files at the top of the repo, you can compile/minify the files into the `dist` directory by running `node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js`

Once that's done, you can point your browser to `tests/index.html` to run the [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) test suite. You can view the [current test results here](http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/tests).

The easiest way to modify the code and work with the examples is to leave a `node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js watch serve` command running, which will automatically compile the CoffeeScript files when they are modified and will also run a local web server you can connect to to run the tests and examples.
